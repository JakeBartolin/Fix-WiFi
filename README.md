# Wi-Fi Fixer Script

This PowerShell script was originally developed as an internal tool for personal use but later extended to assist service desk representatives in troubleshooting Wi-Fi network issues. Working closely with the organization's networking team, I identified a set of standardized troubleshooting steps aimed at reducing human error and decreasing resolution times. By automating these steps, the script simplifies the process of troubleshooting Wi-Fi connectivity problems, DNS cache management, adapter configurations, and Wi-Fi profile handling.

## Remote Support Accessibility
Designed to be seamlessly copied and pasted into an end-user's terminal during remote support sessions, this script offers a convenient alternative to transferring and executing an external script file. This streamlined approach eliminates the need for file transfers, making it quicker and easier to initiate troubleshooting procedures.
